# isaac-log-viewer

A real time viewer for the log.txt file of *The Binding of Isaac: Repentance*. The idea is that you open a new terminal, put it on your second monitor, start the script, and then have the terminal window up as you play the game (and code) on your main monitor.

The script is relatively simple, so you can edit the `main.py` file to customize the specific lines that are matched and the specific colors used.

## Usage

- `pip install -r requirements` (to install the required dependencies)
- `python main.py --help` (to list the possible arguments)
- `python main.py` (to run the program)
