# isaac-log-viewer

A real time viewer for the log.txt file of *The Binding of Isaac: Repentance*.

The script is relatively simple, so you can edit the `main.py` file to customize the specific lines that are matched and the specific colors used.

## Usage

- `pip install -r requirements` (to install the required dependencies)
- `python main.py --help` (to list the possible arguments)
- `python main.py` (to run the program)
